For the Navigation Bar, I noticed that the mobile app had it on the bottom, while the desktop version had it on the top. Additionally, the desktop version spans around a quarter of the screen while the mobile app version spans the entire width. I decided to incorporate both by having it on the top of the screen like the desktop version and spanning it across the entire width like the mobile app version.

The homepage of my app, bunder (meaning Business Tinder), is the feed, just like in tinder. In order to navigate towards it if you are in another tab, you can just click on the name/logo in the nav-bar just like in the mobile app. For the job cards, I had the image be the company's logo, with texts detailing the company name, location, what they are looking for in terms of field, and what type of employment as well whether it is an unpaid internship, paid internship, full-time, or part-time. I also added ads very similar to the tinder ads that encourage subscribing to them to get more matches. I thought it would be interesting to add it to the feed, aside from only the profile section like the app does, because it is easy to get frustrated when receiving no matches and running through all the likes. It could be good for business to have the opportunity to attain more matches displayed in front of you in the form of said ads. Under the cards, there is also three buttons being the previous, NOPE, and LIKE buttons on tinder. They do not do anything yet, but they would theoretically work in the same way. 

To get to the profile page, you click on your avatar in the top right. The aforementioned ads are displayed on the left just like in the desktop version with your job card to the right of it. This job card represents what companies would see when they open the app. The Job card has a formal picture of me, my location, my university as well as my year, my current employment (if any), and what I am searching for. Although this is not implemented, an idea I had was to utilize a filter system that matches what I am searching for with what companies are searching for, so in the feed it would only show those "matched" companies. My information is kept in the Me.js file and companies' information are kept in the Companies.js file. One index of both files is the "searching" index which is what I and the companies are looking for respectively. The filter system would try matching those index and display only the ones that match. There are similar indexes as well that could be used in the same way such as the "location" index in case I wanted to stay in the same area or not. There is also an edit info button below my job card like in tinder, but does not do anything yet. 

In order to navigate to the Messages section, just click on "Messages" in the nav-bar. On the top of the page, you can see images of your matches and below that is the direct messages portion with a New Direct Message Button. The images of the matches at the top of the screen are similar to the cards at the top of the messages system in tinder. Although pressing on them do not do anything yet, what I want them to do is open the chat with that company or if there is not any yet, then create a new chat. The images also have a subheading in the image detailing what they are searching for.
